#The add format is:  [Measurement, P or F].  All other test data should be the same, including incorrectly done tests.

FORMAT IS IMPORTANT!  
<number> Pin:[measurement, P/F], [ ...

<number> dictates the test type (correct, or various forms of incorrect).  The numbers are arbitrary but very important.  Do not touch them.
Pin is the pin that is being tested.
measuerment is the measurement taken at the pin.
P/F is P for pass, F for fail.  Please only include one.

Each new test is to be stored in line with the pin.  Add new data using the "&" character, followed by the new data in brackets.
Please use the spacing shown (none).  While not critical, your table will look rather odd if you don't.
